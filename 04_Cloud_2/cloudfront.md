# CloudFront

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) composed of distributed servers that securely delivers content to a user based on the geographic location of the user, the origin of the data, and the content delivery server. Copies of the content will be cached at Edge Location, which will reduce latency when global users access the content.

* Cloudfront uses a global network of edge locations to deliver entire website or application including static, dynamic, streaming, and interactive content.

* When a user requests content, the request is automatically routed to the nearest edge location so that the content is delivered with the lowest latency.

* Cloudfront works with other AWS such as S3, EC2, ELB, Route53. Also with non-AWS
