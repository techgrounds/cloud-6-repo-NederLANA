# Route53
Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It routes end users to internet applications by translating web domain names to the numberic IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) that computers use to connect to eachother. 

Route53 connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS (i.e. EC2, ELB, load balancers, or S3) and outside of AWS. 

Features include:

* Route53 Application Recovery Controller - configure DNS health checks and continous monitoring.

* Route53 Traffic Flow - manage global user traffic through variety of routing types (Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, Geoproximity, and Weighted Round Robin)

* DNS Failover - enables fault-tolerant architectures.

* Route53 Resolver DNS firewall - configured to inspect outbound DNS request against a list of malicious domains.

* Domain Name Registration - can purchase and manage domain names with DNS configured automatically.
