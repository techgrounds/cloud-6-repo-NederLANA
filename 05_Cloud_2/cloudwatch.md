Amazon CloudWatch presents a single platform to collect, access, and correlate this data across all AWS resources, helping to break down data silos to gain system-wide visibility and quickly resolve issues.

-provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, and optimize resource utilization. 

-collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events and returns a unified view of operational health

-detects anomalous behavior in environments, set alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep applications running smoothly.

-natively integrates with more than 70 AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Lambda.

-use **CloudWatch Events** for serverless to trigger workflows with services like AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, and AWS CloudFormation.
