# Trusted Advisor
AWS Trusted Advisors provides recommendations that help help an organization follow AWS (and also perhaps, industry) best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates the account by using checks. These checks identify ways to optimize AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. Simply follow the check recommendations to optimize services and resources.

• Trusted Advisor provides real time guidance to help provision resources
following best practices.

Trusted Advisor scans the AWS infrastructure and compares it to AWS best practices in
five categories and provides recommended actions:

1) Cost Optimization
2) Performance
3) Security
4) Fault Tolerance
5) Service Limits

Trusted Advisor comes in two versions: **Core Checks** and **Recommendations** (free).
*AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers can only access core security checks and all checks for service quotas only via the [Trusted ADvisor console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/trustedadvisor)*

*Higher plans can also access via the AWS Support API or CLI*

-Access to the 7 core checks to help increase security and performance.

-Checks include S3 bucket permissions, Security Groups, IAM use, MFA on root
account, EBS public snapshots, RDS public snapshots.
