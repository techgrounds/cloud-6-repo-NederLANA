# [Working with text CLI]
Every command in Linux has a standard input and output.
The standard input (stdin) is the keyboard. If I run ‘mkdir myfolder’, the mkdir command will know what folder to create, because I typed ‘myfolder’.
The standard output (stdout) is the terminal. The command ‘echo hello’ will write ‘hello’ in the terminal.Both the input and output can be redirected to a file instead of the default. This is called input redirection and output redirection. 
A pipe can be used to have the output of one command be the input of another command.

## Key-terms


## Opdracht

*Use the echo command and output redirection to write a new sentence into your text file using the command line. The new sentence should contain the word ‘techgrounds’.

*Use a command to write the contents of your text file to the terminal. Make use of a command to filter the output so that only the sentence containing ‘techgrounds’ appears.

*Read your text file with the command used in the second step, once again filtering for the word ‘techgrounds’. This time, redirect the output to a new file called ‘techgrounds.txt’.
