## What is Markdown and how do you use it

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

**Why Use Markdown?**
You might be wondering why people use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG editor. Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are a couple different reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.

* Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.

* Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.

* Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.

* Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.

* Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

# Examples
Here's a list of the non-alphabetic characters that are used in Markdown, their corresponding names, and what styling they're used for.

## Hashtag (Used to create Headers or to reference another Issue) 
(Adding more hashtags create smaller sub headings)

**Asterisk** (Put 2 * on each side of the text you'd like to bold)

_Underscore_ (Put a _ on each side of the text you'd like to _italicize_)

~Tilde~ (Put a ~ on each side of the text you'd like to strikethrough).

[Opening square brackets, and] Closing square brackets are used to make checklists 

Dash and [ ] will create checklist items that can be ticked off in the Issue
- [ ] like this

‐ Dash (One dash is used before text to make an unordered list. 

Three dashes in a row between paragraphs is used to make a line)

---

>Greater than symbol (Used in front of text that you'd like to transform into a quote)

@Mention character (Used to reference another user)

Under the tilde is a backtick (Put 3 backticks  on either side of code to create snippets of code and have them appear as one block)
