# [Files en directories]
Linux uses files and folders, like you’re used to with any OS you’ve used. Folders in Linux are called directories, so use that word when looking for commands or information.

Whenever you open a terminal, you’ll start working from your home directory. From there you can move to any directory in the entire system using just a couple of commands.

The Linux filesystem starts at the root directory, represented by a slash (/). All files and directories in Linux are represented by their path, starting from root.
The tilde (~) is used as an alias for your home directory.
