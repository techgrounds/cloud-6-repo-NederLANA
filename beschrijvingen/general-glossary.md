Assignment 11-Binary

### Bits
It reflects the basic logical process of a transistor: a single unit of information reflecting a zero (no charge) or a one (a completed, charged circuit). **There are eight bits in one byte of information.** Colloquially, bits (and their successively larger relatives, such as kilobits, megabits and gigabits) are used to **measure rates of data transfer.** The abbreviation “Mbps” refers to “megabits,” not “megabytes,” per second.

### Bytes
A byte represents eight bits, and is the most commonly used term relating to the amount of information stored within a computer’s memory. When abbreviated, the “B” is capitalized, so as to set it apart from its smaller relative; “Gb” is short for “gigabit,” and “GB” is short for “gigabyte.”

Assignment 12-IP Addresses

### Private IP Addresses
Every device that connects to your internet network has a private IP address. This includes computers, smartphones, and tablets but also any Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers, printers, or smart TVs. With the growing internet of things, the number of private IP addresses you have at home is probably growing. Your router needs a way to identify these items separately, and many items need a way to recognize each other. Therefore, your router generates private IP addresses that are unique identifiers for each device that differentiate them on the network.

### Public IP Addresses
A public IP address is the primary address associated with your whole network. While each connected device has its own IP address, they are also included within the main IP address for your network. As described above, your public IP address is provided to your router by your ISP. Typically, ISPs have a large pool of IP addresses that they distribute to their customers. Your public IP address is the address that all the devices outside your internet network will use to recognize your network.

### NAT IP
Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process where a network device, usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer (or group of computers) inside a private network. The main use of NAT is to conserve the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use, for both economy and security purposes on both sides of the firewall.

### IPv4 vs IPv6 Addresses
IPv6 (IP version 6) is the most recent generation of the Internet Protocol (IP) defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  Whereas IPv6 is intended to eventually replace IPv4, they are tightly mingled right now—most engineers run them together, but separately in what is called "dual stack". Due to the explosion of internet usage and devices, the move to IPv6 became necessary to create more possible IP addresses and the elimination of using NAT. Some other features such as hexidecimal make it more compatible for mobile devices too.
