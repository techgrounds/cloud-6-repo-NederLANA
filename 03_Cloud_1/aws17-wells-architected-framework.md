# Wells Architected Framework
The way you set up your IT or your application, the architecture, is a big part of how your application runs, how secure it is, and how much it costs. To help designing architectures, AWS has the Well Architected Framework (WAF, not to be confused with the Web Application Firewall).
WAF consists of five pillars, all with their own key concepts, design principles, and best practices. You should be able to name these pillars, as well as understand what they mean. You should also be able to think about architectures in the context of the Well Architected Framework.

The mnemonic device for the six pillars is CROPSs (the first letter of each pillar). The pillars are:

**Cost optimization** - avoiding unnecessary costs. 
Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

**Reliability** - workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. 
Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.

**Operational Excellence** - running and monitoring systems, and continually improving processes and procedures. 
Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.

**Performance efficiency** - structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. 
Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.

**Security** - protecting information and systems. 
Key topics include data confidentiality and integrity, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.

**Sustainability** - minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. 
Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts. 

The [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected), available at no cost in the AWS Management Console, provides a mechanism for regularly evaluating workloads, identifying high-risk issues, and recording improvements.

AWS also provides access to an ecosystem of hundreds of members in the AWS Well-Architected Partner Program. [Engage a partner](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/results/?facets=%27Program+%3A+Well+Architected%27&size=10&start=0&sort=Relevance&view=Grid) in your area to help analyze and review your applications.

AWS Well-Architected Lenses extend the guidance offered by AWS Well-Architected to specific industry and technology domains, such as machine learning (ML), data analytics, serverless, high performance computing (HPC), IoT, SAP, streaming media, the games industry, hybrid networking, and financial services. To fully evaluate workloads, use applicable lenses together with the AWS Well-Architected Framework and its six pillars.
