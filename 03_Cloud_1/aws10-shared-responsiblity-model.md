## Shared Responsibility Model
The Shared Responsibility Model describes who is responsible for the security of what part of the cloud. In general, you can say that AWS is responsible for security **of** the cloud, while the customer is responsible for security **in** the cloud. AWS is always responsible for securing the physical infrastructure, while the customer is always responsible for encrypting customer data.

**Applying the AWS Shared Responsibility Model in Practice**
Once a customer understands the AWS Shared Responsibility Model and how it generally applies to operating in the cloud, they must determine how it applies to their use case. Customer responsibility varies based on many factors, including the AWS services and Regions they choose, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and the laws and regulations applicable to their organization and workload.

The following exercises can help customers in determining the distribution of responsibility based on specific use case:
