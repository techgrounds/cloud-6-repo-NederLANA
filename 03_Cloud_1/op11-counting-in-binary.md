# Binary Code
Computers don’t understand words or numbers the way humans do. Modern software allows the end user to ignore this, but at the lowest levels of your computer, everything is represented by a binary electrical signal that registers in one of two states: on or off. To make sense of complicated data, your computer has to encode it in binary.

Binary is a base 2 number system. Base 2 means there are only two digits—1 and 0—which correspond to the on and off states your computer can understand. Modern computers use what’s known as a transistor to perform calculations with binary, keeping to the same fundamental principles upon which earlier computers were built.

While ternary computers have been built, and ternary logic is more efficient, no effective replacement for the binary transistor has been found. In addition, binary math is way easier for a computer. Boolean logic maps easily to binary systems, with True and False being represented by on and off. 

**Counting in binary**
In binary, the first digit is worth 1 in decimal. The second digit is worth 2, the third worth 4, the fourth worth 8, and so on—doubling each time. Adding these all up gives you the number in decimal.

There’s another base system that’s also used in programming: hexadecimal (used in IPv6). Although computers don’t run on hexadecimal, programmers use it to represent binary addresses in a human-readable format when writing code. This is because two digits of hexadecimal can represent a whole byte, eight digits in binary. Hexadecimal uses 0-9 like decimal, and also the letters A through F to represent the additional six digits.
