# Key-value Pairs
Introduction:
Key-value pairs are a general concept you will definitely encounter. Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS resource tags. Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information.Dicts in Python are written using curly brackets {}. You can get values from the dict by calling its key.
